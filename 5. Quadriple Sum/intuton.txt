1. Why 2 ptr:
    |
    Coz we can easily find out dual sum in O(n)

2. Algo:
    |
    (a) First half sum:  Check for the i, j through 2 for loops {Also check for duplicates earlier}
    |
    (b) Next half sum: Check for the l, h through 2 ptr approach {Also check for duplicates}
    |
    (c) If half_sm1 + half_sm2 == target, then append to res

3. Keep in mind:
    |
    (a) Always know the limits for i, j 
    |
    (b) Always beaware how to use 'continue' to chk duplicates
