1. Why 2 ptr:
    |
    Coz we can keep track of both str through two ptr

2. Algo:
    |
    (a) Find the next valid index {through helper mthd}
    |
    (b) In helper mthd {always keep cnt on the num of skipped chars}

3. Keep in mind:
    |
    (a) We always iterate throgh last {coz we need to delete the elems prev to hash}
    |
    (b) Revise multiple times all the cases for main mthd {to return Tue or False}
